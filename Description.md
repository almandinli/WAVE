# 🌊 **WAVE**  
**Waterborne pathogens And Vulnerability to Environmental change**

**WAVE** is a satellite-powered machine learning algorithm focused on the **prevention of waterborne disease epidemics**.

---

## 🚨 **Problem**

Climate change is becoming a crucial element in the systematic study of waterborne disease.  
Environmental factors are closely interlinked with vector and waterborne diseases:

- Intense heat waves  
- Rising sea levels  
- Algal overgrowth  

These phenomena negatively impact **drinking water quality** and influence the **spread of diseases**, posing **serious risks to human health**.

---

## 💡 **Solution**

**WAVE** identifies the **major environmental factors** and changes that could lead to **waterborne illness**, and supports:

- NGOs  
- Emergency teams  
- Hospital facilities  
- Governments  
- Local authorities  

It provides **early warnings** and recommends the **best responses** to minimize outbreak risks.

## 🛰️ **EU Space Technology**

WAVE integrates advanced **EU space systems** for maximum precision and monitoring capabilities:

- **Galileo** (with EGNOS) for accurate **geolocation** and tracing of potential epidemics  
- **Copernicus Earth Observation** (Sentinel satellites) to monitor **environmental changes** affecting disease spread

## 🏥 **EU Space For Healthcare**

**Topic**: _"Monitoring Disease Outbreaks and Health Risks"_

Our project focuses on **modeling the spread of waterborne diseases** to:

- Support **national and local authorities**
- Provide **real-time data** during climate change-related events
- Enable **data-driven decision-making**
